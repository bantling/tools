TODO:

* For qemu-vms/create.sh:
  * add zfs support
    * pacman -U can take a URL for a package, so try finding a version in https://archzfs.com/archive_archzfs that
      matches ISO kernel version, need following packages:
    ** zfs-linux-lts
    ** zfs-utils
    * use GRUB, only BIOS bootloader that can reside in ZFS partition
    * create zpool named zpool-(generated UUID)
    * use "zpool set autoexpand=on pool" to ensure it has autoexpand on so it can auto expand if disk image and partition size are increased
    * zpool has one device of /dev/disk/by-partuuid/{part uuid}
    * create dataset zpool-(generated UUID)/root with compression on using latest algorithm
    * create zvol for swap space, 16GB in size (shows as /dev/zd0 at runtime)
    * root has legacy mountpoint of /mnt/zfs
    * fstab has no entry for root
    * fstab has swap entry
      /dev/zvol/zboot/swap    none            swap            discard                 0 0
    * set bootloader to use zfs pool
    * resize script should already work, by just expanding partition
