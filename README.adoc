TODO:

* For qemu-vms/qemu-arch-x86_64.sh:
  * download files to current dir, not /tmp - /tmp gets deleted regularly, causing more downloads
  * resize script shd optionally check for prompt about live filesystem, so it works for non-live filesystems
  * set boot loader timeout to 1 second
  * create user named user, with password user
  * add ssh options
    * copy existing SSH public key to /home/user/.ssh = 0700/authorized_keys = 0600
    * generate new key at /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa.{pub,}
  * add zfs support
    * additional FAT 250MB partition for booting, fs label is BOOT1
    * create zpool named zpool-(generated UUID)
    * ensure it has autoexpand on so it can auto expand if disk image and partition size are increased
    * zpool has one device of /dev/disk/by-partuuid/{part uuid}
    * create dataset zpool-(generated UUID)/root with compression on using latest algorithm
    * create zvol for swap space, 16GB in size (shows as /dev/zd0 at runtime)
    * root has legacy mountpoint of /mnt/other
    * fstab has no entry for root
    * fstab has swap entry
      /dev/zvol/zboot/swap    none            swap            discard                 0 0
    * set bootloader to use zfs pool
    * resize script supports zfs
