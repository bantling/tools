= Java Multiple Inheritance

Simple Java code that achieves multiple inheritance:

* An interface can have a getter method that returns an object that contains fields of data
* An interface method can have a default implementation that calls above getter, and operates on the fields of it
* An interface can derive from multiple interfaces
* A class can implement the above multiple interfaces by satisfying their getter methods with appropriate object instances
* The class IS each interface
* The class HAS the behaviour of each interface
* The class can resolve any conflicts where more than interface has the same method, by overriding it and choosing which
  interface method(s) to call
